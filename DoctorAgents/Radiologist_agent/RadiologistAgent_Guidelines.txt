Use the same imaging technique that was performed in the initial workup.

Consider preoperative RT for marginally resectable lesions.

Imaging of the primary site as clinically indicated (eg, X-ray and MRI (with and without contrast ± CT)

Chest Imaging

Bone Scan (optional)

If malignant transformation is suspected, treat as osteosarcoma [(Refer to OSTEO-1)]

Localized Disease → Follow GCTB-2

Metastatic Disease at Presentation → Follow GCTB-2

Is the tumor Resectable?

Yes, Resectable→ Perform Excision→ Continue to Surveillance (GCTB-3)

No (Resectable with unacceptable morbidity and/or Unresectable axial lesions) → Denosumab (preferred) and/or Serial embolization (preferred) and/or Radiation therapy (RT)

Next, Imaging to assess response, Plain X-rays, and contrast-enhanced CT ± MRI.

Stable/Improved Disease → Proceed to Surveillance (GCTB-3)

If it changes to resectable → Perform Excision → Surveillance (GCTB-3)

If remains unresectable → Surveillance (GCTB-3)

If it becomes Progressive Disease → repeat treatment from beginning OR if remains unresectable → Surveillance (GCTB-3)

Is the tumor resectable?

Yes, resectable → For primary tumor, treat as above Consider excision of metastatic sites→ Continue to Surveillance (GCTB-3)

No (Unresectable) → Consider the following options:

Then proceed to Surveillance (GCTB-3)

Intralesional excision with an effective adjuvant may be adequate.

Imaging of Surgical Site as Clinically Indicated
(e.g., X-ray, Contrast-Enhanced CT, and/or MRI)

Chest Imaging Every 6–12 months for 4 years Then annually thereafter, as clinically indicated.

Resectable → Consider Chest Imaging → Consider Denosumab Prior to Surgery (GCTB-2)
