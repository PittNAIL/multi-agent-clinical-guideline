Intralesional Excision ± Surgical Adjuvant OR

Wide excision optional in expendable bones.

Wide excision if resectable or consider radiation therapy (RT) if borderline resectable or unresectable (category 2B) (BONE-C)

→ Wide excision, if resectable or RT, if unresectable (category 2B)

Surgical margins

Positive margins→ Consider radiation therapy (RT) (category 2B) or Consider re-excision to achieve negative surgical margins.

Negative margins → Observe.

Wide excision should provide histologically negative surgical margins. This may be achieved by either limb-sparing excision or limb amputation.

Surgical excision of all sites if possible

Consider RT (radiation therapy), surgery, and/or ablative therapies for symptomatic sites.

Wide Excision ± Adjuvant RT → Go to Step 3

Intralesional Excision (maximal safe excision, maximal tumor removal I recommended when appropriate) ± Adjuvant RT → Follow-up contrast-enhanced MRI of primary site to assess adequacy of excision→ Go to Step 3B.

If positive surgical margins

If positive surgical margins

Consider Re-excision if necessary.

Surgical excision (Principles of Bone Cancer Management (BONE-A) and/or

Surgical excision (Principles of Bone Cancer Management (BONE-A)) and/or

Progressive Disease Following Primary Treatment → Consider RT and/or Surgery for Local Control or Palliation→ Continue to Progressive Disease/Relapse

Wide Excision

Positive Margins → Continue chemotherapy (Category 1) Followed by RT or RT and chemotherapy (category 1, for chemotherapy) → Continue to Surveillance

Negative Margins → Chemotherapy (category 1) and consider RT for pelvic tumors→ Continue to Surveillance

Amputation (Selected Cases) → Continue to Surveillance

Relapse → Chemotherapy ± RT ± Surgery

RT may be considered for close margins.

Wide Excision

Positive Margins → Continue chemotherapy (category 1) → Followed by Radiation Therapy (RT) or RT and chemotherapy (category 1, for chemotherapy) → Continue to Metastases

Negative Margins → Chemotherapy (category 1) → Continue to Metastases

Continuing chemotherapy only with palliative surgery

Oligometastatic Disease → Excision of metastases or RT

Lung Only (Partial Response) → Excision ± Whole Lung Irradiation (WLI)

RT may be considered for close margins.

Yes, Resectable→ Perform Excision→ Continue to Surveillance (GCTB-3)

If it changes to resectable → Perform Excision → Surveillance (GCTB-3)

Yes, resectable → For primary tumor, treat as above Consider excision of metastatic sites→ Continue to Surveillance (GCTB-3)

Intralesional excision with an effective adjuvant may be adequate.

Resectable → Consider Chest Imaging → Consider Denosumab Prior to Surgery (GCTB-2)

Risk of local recurrence is increased when denosumab is used prior to curettage. Denosumab may be beneficial to define peripheral tumor extent when planning wide excision.

Low-Grade Osteosarcoma (Intramedullary + Surface) → Wide Excision

Periosteal Osteosarcoma → Consider Chemotherapy → Wide Excision

Proceed to Wide Excision

Positive Margins:

Consider additional local therapy (surgical excision ± RT)

Consider additional local therapy (surgical excision ± RT)

Negative Margins:

Selected older patients may benefit from immediate surgery.

Chemotherapy and/or excision if possible.
