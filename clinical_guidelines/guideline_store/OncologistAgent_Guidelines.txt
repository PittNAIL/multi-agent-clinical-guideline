Refer to appropriate NCCN Guidelines for Treatment by Cancer Type

There is a considerable controversy regarding the grading of chondrosarcoma. In addition to histology, radiologic features, size, and location of tumors should also be considered in deciding local treatment.

Primary Treatment for Atypical Cartilaginous Tumors

Surveillance

There is no known standard chemotherapy options for conventional chondrosarcoma grades 1-3, but ivosidenib is an option for susceptible IDH1 mutations. See Systemic Therapy Agents (BONE-B)

1. Primary Treatment for:

Treatment includes:

NO: Proceed to surveillance

2. Surveillance

Systemic Recurrence

There is no known standard chemotherapy options for conventional chondrosarcoma grades 1-3, but ivosidenib is an option for susceptible IDH1 mutations. See Systemic Therapy Agents (BONE-B).

Consider systemic therapy

Alternative Treatment Approach
May consider treating as osteosarcoma (category 2B) .

Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) and MMR/MSI Testing
Consider testing for tumor mutational burden (TMB) and mismatch repair/microsatellite instability (MMR/MSI) as determined by a validated and/or FDA-approved assay to inform treatment options.

Follow Presentation and Primary Treatment (CHOR-2)

Chordoma Treatment Decision Tree

Step 2A: Primary Treatment for Sacrococcygeal and Mobile Spine

Consider Definitive RT → Go to Surveillance (CHOR-3)

Step 2B: Primary Treatment for Skull Base/Clival

Consider Definitive RT → Go to Surveillance (CHOR-3)

Step 3A: Adjuvant Treatment

Step 3B: Adjuvant Treatment

Final Step: Surveillance

Proceed to Surveillance Guidelines (CHOR-3)

Surveillance:

→ Treatment Options:

Ablation and or Systemic therapy or

→ Treatment Options:

Systemic therapy (Bone Cancer Systemic Therapy Agents (BONE-B)), consider testing for TMB and MMR/MSI as determined by a validated and/or FDA approved assay to inform treatment options and/or

Consider testing for TMB (Tumor Mutational Burden) and MMR/MSI for treatment decisions.

Primary Treatment:

Multiagent Chemotherapy (Category 1) for at least 9 weeks prior to local therapy

Longer treatment prior to local control therapy can be considered in patients with metastatic disease based on response.

Step 1: Primary Treatment Response

Stable/Improved Disease Following Primary Treatment → Proceed to Local Control Therapy

Progressive Disease Following Primary Treatment → Consider RT and/or Surgery for Local Control or Palliation→ Continue to Progressive Disease/Relapse

Steps 2+3: Local Control Therapy Options and Adjuvant Treatment/Additional Therapy

Positive Margins → Continue chemotherapy (Category 1) Followed by RT or RT and chemotherapy (category 1, for chemotherapy) → Continue to Surveillance

Negative Margins → Chemotherapy (category 1) and consider RT for pelvic tumors→ Continue to Surveillance

Definitive RT and Chemotherapy→ Continue to Surveillance

Amputation (Selected Cases) → Continue to Surveillance

Step 4: Surveillance

Relapse → Chemotherapy ± RT ± Surgery

Progressive Disease → Chemotherapy or Best Supportive Care

Bone Cancer Systemic Therapy Agents (BONE-B)

There is category 1 evidence for between 28 and 49 weeks of chemotherapy depending on the chemotherapy and dosing schedule used.

Positive Margins → Continue chemotherapy (category 1) → Followed by Radiation Therapy (RT) or RT and chemotherapy (category 1, for chemotherapy) → Continue to Metastases

Negative Margins → Chemotherapy (category 1) → Continue to Metastases

Definitive RT + Chemotherapy→ Continue to Metastases

Continuing chemotherapy only with palliative surgery

Bone Cancer Systemic Therapy Agents (BONE-B)

There is category 1 evidence for between 28 and 49 weeks of chemotherapy depending on the chemotherapy and dosing schedule used.

Consider testing for TMB (category 2B) and MMR/MSI as determined by a validated and/or FDA-approved assay to inform treatment options.

Yes, Resectable→ Perform Excision→ Continue to Surveillance (GCTB-3)

Treatment Response:

Stable/Improved Disease → Proceed to Surveillance (GCTB-3)

If it changes to resectable → Perform Excision → Surveillance (GCTB-3)

If remains unresectable → Surveillance (GCTB-3)

If it becomes Progressive Disease → repeat treatment from beginning OR if remains unresectable → Surveillance (GCTB-3)

Yes, resectable → For primary tumor, treat as above Consider excision of metastatic sites→ Continue to Surveillance (GCTB-3)

Then proceed to Surveillance (GCTB-3)

Denosumab may be continued until disease progression, in responding disease.

Bone Cancer Systemic Therapy Agents (BONE-B).

Treatment of primary tumor is as described for localized disease.

Step 1: Surveillance

Step 2: Primary Treatment

High-Grade? → Chemotherapy (Category 1) → Surveillance (OSTEO-4)

Low-Grade? → Surveillance (OSTEO-4)

Periosteal Osteosarcoma → Consider Chemotherapy → Wide Excision

High-Grade? → Chemotherapy (Category 1) → Surveillance (OSTEO-4)

Low-Grade? → Surveillance (OSTEO-4)

➤ Neoadjuvant Treatment

Preoperative chemotherapy (Category 1)

Restage with pretreatment imaging modalities:

Adjuvant Treatment:

Chemotherapy

Continue preoperative regimen OR consider changing chemotherapy (Category 3)

1. Surveillance Phase:

Chemotherapy and/or excision if possible.

If Response detected→ Return to Surveillance Phase.
